# ü™ñ TANK GAME

_A strategic, top-down tank shooter where reflexes, tactics, and firepower determine your survival._

## About The Project

**Tank Game** is a single-player action game built with the Unity engine. In this game, you control a powerful battle tank through enemy-infested arenas, using agility and precision shooting to survive and dominate. Your mission is to eliminate all hostile forces while navigating obstacles, collecting power-ups, and upgrading your tank.

This game is developed and maintained by [M-Mikran-Sandhu](https://github.com/M-Mikran-Sandhu), and is hosted at [M-Mikran-Sandhu/Unity](https://github.com/M-Mikran-Sandhu/Unity).  

The project started as a learning exercise in Unity but has evolved into a polished, arcade-style shooter with responsive controls, AI opponents, and an engaging gameplay loop.
